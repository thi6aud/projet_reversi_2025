Heuristics are here to let the AI know what is best to play based on a score:

Game phases:
  Depending on the game advencement (phase) actions don't have the same weight
  - Phase 1 "opening": 60-44 empty cells -> emphasizes mobility and risk
  - Phase 2 "midgmae": 44-20 empty cells -> emphasizes mobility and board control
  - Phase 3 "endgame": 20-0 empty cells -> emphasizes discs count

Score:
  To get the score of a move we calculate sum[subscores(i) * weights(i)]

Subscores:
  - mobility -> do you get more mobility than your opponent?
  - corner -> do you access/give-away a corner?
  - risk -> do you give-away a corner? (Really usefull w/ pst?)
  - frontier -> do you have frontier discs?
  - pst -> which cell value are you getting?
  - discs -> do you get more discs than your opponent?

Weights:
  W=[-1.5, 1.5] is a value used to emphasize certain subscores depending
  on the current game phase. (Might need some rework)
